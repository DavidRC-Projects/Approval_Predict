## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

1. In your newly created repo click on the green Code button. 

1. Then, from the Codespaces tab, click Create codespace on main.

1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

1. Open a new terminal and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory, and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

Note that the kernel says Python 3.12.1 as it inherits from the workspace, so it will be Python-3.12.1 as installed by Codespaces. To confirm this, you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked


You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.


## Dataset Content
This dataset simulates loan applications and approval outcomes for 2,000 individuals. It contains demographic, financial, and employment-related attributes that can be used to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The data has 8 columns and 2000 rows, this dataset size will be useful as its large enough to hopefully demonstrate patterns in the data and small enough to run quickly in codespace.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/loan-approval-dataset/loan_approval.csv')
```


## Business Requirements

The client is a fictitious financial institution that processes a large number of loan applications daily. Manual review of loan applications is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The institution wants to understand what factors contribute most to loan approval decisions and whether loan approvals can be accurately predicted to streamline operations and improve risk assessment.

What are the business objectives?
Which variables are most associate with the target loan_approved to under the drivers of loan approval
Rank the features by importance and there impact on the probability of getting approval.
Is there any citys that has the most approvals for product and service insights
Provide an actionable guide to potentical applicants by identifying top 3 influence factors to recommend specific improvements and higher chances of having an a loan approved.

Is there any business objective that can be answered with conventional data analysis?



## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case



## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
Added the code ! unzip {DestinationFolder}/*.zip -d {DestinationFolder} \
    && rm {DestinationFolder}/*.zip \
    && rm kaggle.json
    this required - o to overwrite the zip command as there as already a csv file uploaded




## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-24](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.
